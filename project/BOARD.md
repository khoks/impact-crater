# Board

> **Last updated:** 2026-05-05 — **E-2.4 (M3 UI MVP loop closed) DONE.** All 5 stories closed. The full UI loop (Wizard → Dashboard → New Project → Effort+Cost → In-Progress → Preview) is wired against an async-jobs API with WebSocket progress events; Settings panel ships in the same epic. M3 piggybacked an M1 follow-up: per-call LLMCallEvent telemetry + ProgressSink in the LLMRouter, so `JobCostSummary` finally populates and the live-spend panel updates in real time. **218 tests green** (185 backend unit + 26 frontend unit + 7 backend integration). M0+M1+M2+M3 are all behind us; **E-2.5 (M4 music-video) and E-2.6 (M5 person library + privacy) are both Up Next — parallelizable.**
> **How to read this:** Hand-maintained mirror of frontmatter `status:` values. The `work-tracker` skill refreshes this file at end-of-session. If you see drift, re-derive from `grep -l "status:" project/{initiatives,epics,stories,tasks}/*.md`.
