  "reason": "Before ending this session, run two project skills in order. Each opens a PR to master and immediately auto-merges it with 'gh pr merge --squash --delete-branch' per docs/architecture/ADR-0004-skill-pr-auto-merge.md (which supersedes the original 'never auto-merge' clause of ADR-0003). Review happens live in the session as the changes are made; merged PRs remain fully revertible via gh pr revert.\n\n1. **knowledge-curator** — sweep this conversation for any new vision items, feature ideas, architectural / performance / scaling / infrastructure / tech-stack decisions, novel or patentable ideas, and crucial product or engineering decisions. Update the matching docs: docs/vision/RECOMMENDED_ADDITIONS.md, docs/architecture/ARCHITECTURE.md or a new ADR, docs/decisions/DECISIONS_LOG.md, docs/vision/NOVEL_IDEAS.md. Branch auto/knowledge-curator-${SESSION_ID:0:8}, commit, push, gh pr create --base master, then gh pr merge --squash --delete-branch. Skip only if the conversation introduced literally nothing new worth persisting — and say so explicitly.\n\n2. **work-tracker** — sweep this conversation for new requirements / scope changes / status changes affecting Initiatives, Epics, Stories, or Tasks under project/. Create new items where needed (using project/TEMPLATES/), update statuses with activity-log entries, and refresh project/BOARD.md. Branch auto/work-tracker-${SESSION_ID:0:8}, commit, push, gh pr create --base master, then gh pr merge --squash --delete-branch. Skip only if nothing changed — and say so.\n\nThen mark this session housekept so this hook stops blocking:\n\n  mkdir -p .claude/state && touch .claude/state/housekept-$SESSION_ID\n\nAnd attempt to stop again."
